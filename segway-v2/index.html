        <h2>CONCEPT CENTAUR</h2>
        <p>Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several
            technologies to
            create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept
            Centaur
            will
            challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
            From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product
            concepts
            with
            the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing."
            During this
            time,
            engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a
            concept
            will
            work.</p>

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was <i>a prince</i>â€”a concept that passed this
            initial
            feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued
            commitment
            to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

        <h2>WHAT IS THE CENTAUR?</h2>

        <p>Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension
            systems,
            and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or
            four
            wheels.</p>
        <p>Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while
            maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation
            make it a
            good low-impact way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor
            and
            outdoor
            recreational and commercial applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="controls" class="container">

        <h3>Intuitive user controls:</h3>

        <h4>Thumbs forward:</h4>
        <p>The Centaur's forward and backward propulsion is easily controlled by pushing a thumb throttle
            located
            on the underside of the right-hand handlebar.</p>

        <h4>Pop a wheelie:</h4>
        <p>The Centaur uses dynamic stabilization technology to limit and/or maintain the angle at which the
            rider
            experiences the device. What would normally be a dangerous maneuver on a motorcycle or ATV becomes safe and
            controlled
            on the Centaur. In addition, the rider can position his/her body in three different ways, which makes for a
            fun
            ride.
            This technology also allows for a high-performance design with a short, compact wheelbase - a combination
            that
            traditionally can be very difficult to control.</p>

        <h4>Lean forward, go forward:</h4>
        <p>If you've haven't yet experienced the Segway PT, now is the time. If you have, you know
            what
            we mean by intuitive controls. Concept Centaur uses dynamic stabilization in a similar way. When on two
            wheels, the
            Centaur is controlled by how the rider shifts his or her weight. To go forward, lean forward. To go back,
            lean back.</p>

    <section id="steering" class="container">
        <h3>Simultaneous mechanical and drive-by-wire steering:</h3>

        <h4>Smart steering:</h4>
        <p>The front two wheels turn left and right mechanically, which is made possible by an
            innovative
            linkage
            system designed by Segway engineers. The Centaur's advanced controls software also allows the rear wheels to
            turn at
            different rates in response to data received from the rider's steering direction. When on two wheels,
            steering
            is
            accomplished in the same manner, by turning the handlebar. Sensors in the vertical portion of the steering
            column
            monitor the rider's input and sends a signal to the controller boards, which then issue a command to drive
            either or
            both of the rear wheels. Turning rate is coordinated so that even with the wheels off the ground, Centaur
            follows
            the
            path defined by the front wheel angles. This allows smooth transitions between two-wheel and four-wheel
            operation.</p>

                        Batteries power the Centaur, so there are no emissions during operation. In addition, the
                        Centaur uses
                        regenerative braking, which means the batteries are recharged during deceleration and hill
                        descents.</figcaption>

        <h3>Distinctive design, elegant suspension:</h3>

        <h4>A profile X-shape:</h4>
        <p>The profile of the Centaur creates an "X." Right after the Centaur was crowned a
            prince by the
            engineers, they quickly pulled in Segway's industrial design team to integrate their vision into the
            product's
            form
            and
            function. What resulted is a concept with a sleek minimalist design that elegantly showcases the rider,
            leaving
            the
            simple mechanical elegance of the underlying design visible.</p>

        <h4>Three shocks:</h4>
        <p>There are three shocks on the Centaur that absorb bumps and help the wheels maintain
            contact with
            the
            ground. There is one in each front "arm" and one in the rear.</p>

        <h4>Lightweight:</h4>
        <p>Concept Centaur only weighs about 150 pounds and can be easily transported in the back of
            a large SUV
            or
            small pick-up truck. If developed, its light weight would allow for transport on the back of small cars
            through
            a
            hitch-mounted rack, similar to that used for carrying bicycles.</p>
