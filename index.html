  <h2>Dragon/Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    For iteration one of the Dragon/Segway project, I sought the feedback of a programmer friend, as well as a graphic design friend. 
    They both indicated that the dark grey in the background was "kinda depressing", which is a critique that I agree with.  At first,
    I had sought to give the page a sort of technological sheen and plan to revise the color scheme slightly.  They also indicated that 
    the buttons were kind of small and that I should perhaps shorten "Segway Centaur" to "Centaur", as it's redundant. </p>
<p>
    As far as things that I would personally do differently, I'm definitely on the same page as my friends.  I'm going to attempt to go 
    for a more sleek design, with a slightly less downer color palette.  Additionally, regarding the full process, I would structure the 
    content to have more of an emphasis on graphics and images.  This would help aid in potentially <i>selling</i> the product.  I've attempted
    to find more high resolution photos of the Centaur concept, but it seems to have become vaporware.

  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Oddly enough, I feel as if I've been unconciously following this philosophy the whole semester. I have a tendency to approach projects
    from the bottom up.  First step is to define what the actual content is.  For example, when parsing the Segway html prompt for 
    logical places to add tags, it was quite a nit-picky endeavor for me, especially with regards to the features/concept/design/environment sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    One segment of the article that really stood out to me was the Peanut M&Ms analogy. Content is the protein, presentation is the chocolate sweetness
    that draws you in/keeps you hooked, and the candy shell helps to protect these contents with a nice functional layer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, coming from a graphic design background, and now moving into cybersecurity, I feel as if I'm getting a glimpse at quite a few of
    these aspects.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this class and look forward to learning more about JS, PHP, and Python as they relate to web applications
    and web design/functionality (as well as server-side!).  This class has helped bridge various interests.
