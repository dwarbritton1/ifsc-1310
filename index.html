  <h2>Dragon/Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    For iteration one of the Dragon/Segway project, I sought the feedback of a programmer friend, as well as a graphic design friend. 
    They both indicated that the dark grey in the background was "kinda depressing", which is a critique that I agree with.  At first,
    I had sought to give the page a sort of technological sheen and plan to revise the color scheme slightly.  They also indicated that 
    the buttons were kind of small and that I should perhaps shorten "Segway Centaur" to "Centaur", as it's redundant. </p>
<p>
    As far as things that I would personally do differently, I'm definitely on the same page as my friends.  I'm going to attempt to go 
    for a more sleek design, with a slightly less downer color palette.  Additionally, regarding the full process, I would structure the 
    content to have more of an emphasis on graphics and images.  This would help aid in potentially <i>selling</i> the product.  I've attempted
    to find more high resolution photos of the Centaur concept, but it seems to have become vaporware.
